# Pokemon Visiotech

This project is a test made for Visiotech company in which, the final scope of it is to make a Pokemon game battle between 2 trainers, 1vs1, with 2 pokemons each of them.

The project has been carried out with the help of the IDE IntelliJ. Logging has been initiated with Spring, programmed in Java, and the import of dependencies through Maven. For the API, the use of Springboot-JPA and H2Database was planned, which began to be developed.

Throughout the implementation of the project, the best possible ways to develop the application have been sought and which language and tools were best suited to its needs.

Due to this, and the lack of knowledge of those selected, the expected objectives of the test and the planned RoadMap have not been met. The project had a deployment and integration approach that I couldn't get to due to lack of time/experience in these tools.

Thank you in advance for the given opportunity! I've learned so much with this project and my desire to learn has only grown.
